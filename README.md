# Analyzing South Asia's Economic, Social, and Environmental Landscape! 📊
This project started with raw data from Kaggle, which I carefully denormalized into subtables to streamline analysis in Power BI. This setup allowed me to analyze economic growth, health, environment, and urbanization data, shedding light on the region's diverse dynamics. 
## Key Takeaways Across South Asia:
### 1. Economic Growth and Foreign Investment
Tracking GDP growth and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) reveals unique growth patterns across South Asia. Countries with higher FDI often show more consistent GDP growth, suggesting that investment positively impacts economic stability and development. 📈
### 2. Unemployment, Inequality, and Poverty
The dashboard reveals correlations between rising unemployment, poverty rates, and income inequality. For instance, in some countries, an increase in unemployment is associated with a higher Gini index, indicating intensifying economic inequality. 📉
### 3. Health and Social Development
Metrics like life expectancy and infant mortality rates offer a snapshot of healthcare improvements. While life expectancy is increasing, there’s a stark contrast in infant mortality rates across countries, emphasizing areas where healthcare investments could make a significant difference. 🏥
### 4. Inflation’s Impact on Economic Well-being
Inflation trends visualized alongside GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratios reveal how inflation affects purchasing power, especially for lower-income groups, impacting their overall quality of life. 📊
### 5.  Governance and Economic Stability
Tracking governance indicators such as political stability, rule of law, and corruption control shows their role in attracting investment and supporting economic growth. Countries with stronger governance metrics tend to experience more robust economic growth and FDI inflows.
